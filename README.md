# BunnBattle 
BunnBattle integrates zk-SNARKs to create a secure and fair version of the classic Battleship game. The project involves writing smart contracts in Solidity and using libraries like Circom and Snarkjs to implement the zk-SNARK logic. The project aims to demonstrate how zk-SNARKs can be used to ensure fairness and privacy in a decentralized environment and PvP games.

- The project was designed and implemented during the ETHKyiv hackathon June 21-23 of 2024. 

Note: Smart Contracts, protocol, and ZK circuits are implemented and are finalized in the `protocol` branch. While the main branch was used for the full-stack solution development
